Project: Image Watermarking using OpenCV
Implemented an image watermarking system using OpenCV to add both logo-based and text-based watermarks for copyright protection. Utilized NumPy for image processing and PIL for visualization. The project demonstrated how to overlay logos and text on images while preserving image quality.
